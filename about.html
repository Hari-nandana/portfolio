    <p >
Hi there,
Myself Harinandana K Biju, and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at FISAT, Angamaly. I completed my schooling at Carmel CMI Public School, Vazhakulam. I have a passion for programming, with strong skills in C and Java, and I enjoy designing and creating webpages. I am particularly interested in web development and aspire to build innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and user experience.

In my free time, I love expressing my creativity through drawing and painting, which helps me stay inspired and think outside the box. I also enjoy exploring new technologies, attending hackathons, and collaborating with others to solve real-world problems. I have experience working on various projects, including creating dynamic websites and applications using tools like React and Node.js.

I am always eager to learn and challenge myself. Whether it's developing a new app, optimizing code, or designing a visually appealing interface, I strive for excellence in everything I do. I am an active team player, and I believe that collaboration is key to achieving great results.

My future goal is to contribute to cutting-edge advancements in software development and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. Outside of academics and coding, I also enjoy reading about technological trends, traveling, and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds to gain new perspectives.
